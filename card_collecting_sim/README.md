# cards collecting simulator

to start just call:
```
./run
```
all the results will be generated into a temporary folder called `out`.

example results with some explanations are [available on my blog](https://baszerr.eu/doku.php?id=blog:2023:08:17:2023-08-17_-_card_collecting_is_expensive).

SW is not super robust in handling edge cases, but is good enough for playing around.
have fun.
